# Enterprise Endpoint Infrastructure 

## Overview
Automated Enterprise Endpoint management lab demonstrating Active Directory administration, PowerShell automation, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) deployment using Azure DevOps pipelines.

## Environment
- **Cloud platform**: Microsoft Azure
- **Infrastructure**: ARM templates deployed via YAML pipeline
- **Domain Controller**: Windows Server 2019 with Active Directory (Azure VM)
- **Client Endpoints**: Windows 10 workstation (Azure VM)
- **Automation**: PowerShell scripting for user management and deployment

## Key Demonstrations

- Windows Server administration and Active Directory management
- PowerShell scripting and automation
- Group Policy management for software deployment
- Enterprise endpoint lifecycle management
